DK+ (Dronekit plus) is a custom API that aims to extend the functionality of Dronekit-Python. It is being developed for a final research project with interest in the UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) field. Its purpose is to help in prototyping cooperative collision avoidance protocols and, as such, also support communication protocols between drones.
