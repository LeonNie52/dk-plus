This project has started with the intention of continuous extension and optimization. Anyone can copy the source code and modify it to their likings. 

Currently, there are many ideas of how this project can be used for prototyping drone protocols and procedures. There are many capabilities, in terms of algorithms (e.g using AI, trajectory planning, fleet management), that can be easily explored via DK+. 

Also, the design of a distributed/dynamic wireless network for drones is necessary for optimum communication. One idea is to test the network performance with new modules, the most promising of which may be `0MQ <http://zeromq.org>`_ and `Twisted <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/>`_.

So feel free to add your algorithms to work via DK+, exploiting the posibilities given. Currently, there has been no intention to pull the project to Dronekit-Python's GitHub repository since DK+ provides an extra layer that maybe does not belong to the mechanics of the DK context itself, maybe not! If you feel like discussing the subject with the DK contributors please do so.

There are some conventions for better integrity:

- Code format is in accordance to the `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ guidelines. You can use `yapf <https://github.com/google/yapf>`_ for automatic format.
- Documentation is in `reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html#>`_ format with the `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html>`_ documentation generator.
- Versioning adheres to the `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_ rules.
